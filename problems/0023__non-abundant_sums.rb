# The Problem: https://projecteuler.net/problem=23
# ============================================================================
# A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
# exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of
# 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
# 
# A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less
# than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
# 
# As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest
# number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By
# mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123
# can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit
# cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the
# greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers
# is less than this limit.
# Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum
# of two abundant numbers.
