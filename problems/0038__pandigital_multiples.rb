# The Problem: https://projecteuler.net/problem=38
# ============================================================================
# Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:
# 192  1 = 192
# 192  2 = 384
# 192  3 = 576
# By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We
# will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)
# The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4,
# and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product
# of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).
# What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as
# the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n  1?
